## Problem overview
The n queens problem is one in which given n queens place them on a n x n chess board. 
Ensuring they are place such that no 2 queens are:
* In the same row
* In the same colum
* In the same diagonal

the rule on the queens placement result in the following conclusions about the board:
* Size of board has to be n > 2 un less given 1 queen
* if board size n = 3  then there can only be 2 queens
* board size n = q amount for all instance where queen >= 4

## Solution overview
Solution overview describes the procedure in which use the BackTracking Algorithm
n queens are placed on a n x n board ensuring each one is place valid
